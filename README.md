# Monoalphabetic-Cipher-Python-


## Overview

Mono-alphabetic cipher - a class of encryption methods that boil down to the creation of an encryption table according to a certain algorithm, in which for each plaintext letter there is a single cipher-text letter associated with it. The encryption itself consists in replacing letters according to the table. For decryption, it is enough to have the same table, or to know the algorithm by which it is generated.
